# GAN-MCPG-text-generation
Neural text generation model using generative adversarial network and monte carlo policy gradient. 
The generator and discriminator are alternatively made to optimise their objectives.
Monte carlo policy gradient helps the generator in selecting the most appropriate dis-
crete valued character at each time step with unsupervised training.
